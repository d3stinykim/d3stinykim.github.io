      <h1>Iâ€™m</br>a Designer</br>a Photographer</br>a Lover of Animals and Trees</h1>
      <h3>I am originally from Seoul, Korea and have gone to high school in Sedona, Arizona and currently living in New York.
         I consider my being as an introvert, expend energy when around people and recharge in my time alone. In this time
         alone, I often read books, watch movies or dramas, listen to music, check out exhibitions or galleries, walk around
         a park or riverside, take photographs and do lots of others.</h3>

   <div class="description">
      <p>I very much enjoy collecting any kinds of printed materials like leaflets, pamphlets, business cards, postcards,
         or movie posters and most of everything, hand-written letters! I often like to eat in the bed but hate myself spilling
         anything on the blanket at the same time. I clean or cook to procrastinate from a heavy workload and welcome my
         insomnia to excuse myself for a bike ride in the crack of dawn.</p>
      <p>From my childhood, I always find it fun to learn about myself from personality tests like the MBTI or the Enneagram,
         and even through pseudoscientific theory like zodiac signs and blood type. (If this is also fun for you, check out
         the following traits I have!)</p>
